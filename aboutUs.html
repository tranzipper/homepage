                    OUR STORY
                </h3>
                <p class="details" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
                    TranZipper Marketplace was born out of a real-life challenge faced by our founder, JP Layefa, in
                    2018. Layefa found himself struggling financially, despite being a certified photographer with a
                    digital camera. The biggest hurdle? He didn’t have a physical shop to attract customers.

                    In search of a solution, Layefa turned to Google, hoping to find an app that could connect him with
                    potential clients. To his surprise, there was no such platform in Nigeria. Disappointed but
                    determined, he continued to think about how he could bridge this gap.

                    One day, while dressed in his Ankara attire, Layefa heard music coming from a nearby compound.
                    Curious, he walked over, only to find that the celebration—a naming ceremony—was about to be
                    postponed because they couldn’t find a photographer. All the local photographers were already
                    booked. Sensing an opportunity, Layefa quickly fetched his camera, and the event went on as planned.

                    Not only was he paid for his services, but he also enjoyed a plate of delicious Nigerian Jollof.
                    That experience sparked an idea. If he could solve this problem for himself, why not create a
                    platform that could help others too?

                    From that moment, Layefa began developing the TranZipper Marketplace, focusing on user experience
                    and making it easier for professionals and business owners to connect with customers, without the
                    need for a physical shop. Today, TranZipper is a thriving marketplace, helping to reduce
                    unemployment, save money on rent, and connect people across Nigeria to the services they
                    need—quickly and efficiently.

                    The visionary founder and Chief Executive of TranZipper Technologies, has been driven by a deep
                    commitment to building a safe and seamless ecosystem for Nigerians. His journey began at the age of
                    15 when his father, recognizing the value of practical skills, enrolled him in a two-year computer
                    training program. This early exposure to technology laid the foundation for his future endeavors. At
                    19, Layefa’s father further nurtured his potential by enrolling him in photography training,
                    instilling in him the importance of handiwork.

                    With a background in Economics and Political Science, Layefa understands the challenges faced by
                    everyday citizens and is dedicated to making life easier for them. His mission extends beyond
                    technology; he is passionate about empowering individuals to learn valuable skills, encouraging them
                    to pursue handiwork as a means of survival and success.

                    Layefa has devoted his time and energy to creating opportunities for people to earn a living and
                    support their families. TranZipper is a testament to his belief in a better choice for the
                    future—one where creative minds can huddle, collaborate, and build a self-sustaining community.
                    Under his leadership, TranZipper has become a safe haven for professionals, artisans, and business
                    owners to flourish in their craft, transforming the marketplace and impacting lives across Nigeria.
